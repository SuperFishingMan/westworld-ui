# westworld-ui
A little demo of Maeve's radarchart inspired by the UI on Westworld and this subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5bkav5/the_20point_host_personality_chart/

Demo available: http://westworld-ui.surge.sh/

And thanks to the great work from: http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/10/different-look-d3-radar-chart.html and https://github.com/alangrafu/radar-chart-d3 for which this project is based on.
